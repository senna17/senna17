- 👋 Hi, I’m @senna17 (Senna Eswaralingam)
- 👀 I’m interested in prediction and using data to answer policy and business problems.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about machine learning (but I'm generally always learning).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on prediction problems across all fields. That said, reach out if you think I'll be interested - I probably will be.
- 📫 How to reach me: LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/senna-eswaralingam/
